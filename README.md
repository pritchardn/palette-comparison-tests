# Palette Comparison Tests
Preliminary investigation into using blockdags to semantically version control DALiuGE palettes.

This shows the selection of fields from palette nodes to generate signatures.
This is followed by comparing an original and modified palette
and the built-in dag comparison routine which returns which vertices are unique to each DAG.
